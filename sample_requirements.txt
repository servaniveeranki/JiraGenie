PROJECT: Real-Time Ride-Sharing Platform
===========================================

OVERVIEW:
Build a scalable, cloud-native ride-sharing platform similar to Uber/Lyft that connects riders with drivers in real-time.
The system should handle high traffic, provide real-time location tracking, efficient driver matching, and seamless payment processing.

TARGET USERS:
- Riders seeking quick and reliable transportation
- Drivers looking to earn income by providing rides
- Platform administrators managing operations

1. USER MANAGEMENT
   - User registration and authentication (riders and drivers)
   - Profile management with photo, payment methods, and preferences
   - Driver verification and background check integration
   - Rating and review system (5-star ratings)
   - User activity history and trip records

2. RIDE REQUEST & MATCHING
   - Real-time ride request submission with pickup/dropoff locations
   - Intelligent driver matching based on:
     * Proximity to pickup location
     * Driver availability and status
     * Driver ratings and acceptance rate
     * Estimated time of arrival (ETA)
   - Ride request queue management using message queues
   - Support for ride types (economy, premium, shared rides)
   - Price estimation before booking

3. REAL-TIME TRACKING & LOCATION SERVICES
   - Live GPS tracking of driver location
   - Real-time map updates for riders showing driver approach
   - Route optimization using traffic data
   - Geofencing for service areas
   - Location history storage for analytics
   - Redis cache for fast location lookups

4. TRIP MANAGEMENT
   - Trip lifecycle: requested → accepted → in-progress → completed → paid
   - Trip details: route, duration, distance, fare breakdown
   - Trip cancellation with penalty policies
   - In-app chat/call between rider and driver
   - Emergency SOS button with location sharing
   - Persistent trip storage for historical analysis

5. PAYMENT & BILLING
   - Multiple payment methods (credit card, digital wallets, cash)
   - Dynamic pricing with surge pricing during peak hours
   - Automatic fare calculation based on distance, time, and demand
   - Split payment options for shared rides
   - Payment processing integration with Stripe/PayPal
   - Invoice generation and receipt via email
   - Driver earnings dashboard and payout management

6. NOTIFICATIONS & ALERTS
   - Real-time push notifications for:
     * Ride requests (for drivers)
     * Driver acceptance/arrival (for riders)
     * Trip status updates
     * Payment confirmations
     * Promotional offers
   - SMS and email notifications as backup
   - In-app notification center

7. ANALYTICS & REPORTING
   - Real-time operational dashboard showing:
     * Active rides
     * Available drivers
     * Revenue metrics
     * User acquisition trends
   - Historical trip analytics for demand forecasting
   - Driver performance metrics
   - Geographic heatmaps of ride density
   - Revenue and financial reports

- Dispatch Service: Lambda function for driver matching logic
- Location Service: Real-time location processing
- Trip Tracker Service: Active trip monitoring and updates
- ETA Service: Estimated time calculations using traffic data
- Billing Service: Fare calculation and payment processing
- Notification Service: Multi-channel notification delivery

DATA STORAGE:
- User Profiles DB: AWS RDS MySQL for user/driver data
- Trip DB: AWS Keyspaces (Cassandra) for high-volume trip records
- Location Cache: AWS ElastiCache Redis for real-time location data
- Message Queue: AWS SQS for asynchronous ride request processing

ANALYTICS:
- Real-time Analytics: AWS Kinesis + DynamoDB for operational metrics
- Historical Analytics: AWS S3 + Athena for data warehouse
- Location Analytics: Geospatial analysis using PostgreSQL with PostGIS

INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Containerization: Docker containers
- Orchestration: AWS ECS/Fargate
- Load Balancing: Application Load Balancer
